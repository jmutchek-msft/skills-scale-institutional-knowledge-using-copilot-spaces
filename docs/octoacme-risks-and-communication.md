# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution by Project Manager with input from Solutions Architect, QA Lead, and team
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood with cross-functional input from relevant role owners
- Mitigate: reduced via actions and contingency plans developed by relevant role owners
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs facilitated by Scrum Master and Project Manager updates status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based) coordinated by Project Manager
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Support/Success Manager leads customer-facing communications
- Solutions Architect provides technical updates for architecture decisions
- UX Designer shares design insights and user research findings
