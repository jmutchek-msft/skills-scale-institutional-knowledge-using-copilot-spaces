# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This collection of documents defines how OctoAcme delivers software projects using a customer-first, iterative approach that emphasizes clear ownership, psychological safety, and data-informed decision-making. Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or an experienced contributor looking for process details, these guides provide the foundation for effective collaboration and successful project delivery.

OctoAcme's project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible framework spanning five key phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each project begins with a lightweight one-pager that validates business need, identifies stakeholders, and establishes success metrics. During planning, teams break work into shippable increments, define acceptance criteria, and identify dependencies while maintaining a prioritized backlog. Execution emphasizes daily collaboration through standups, weekly delivery syncs, and regular demos, supported by robust quality assurance practices including automated testing, security scanning, and manual QA validation. Releases follow standardized procedures with pre-deployment checklists, smoke testing, and clear rollback plans to minimize risk and maintain production stability.

Central to OctoAcme's approach are clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Project Managers coordinate delivery, manage schedules and risks, and facilitate cross-team communication. Product Managers define what should be built, prioritize the backlog based on customer value, and measure outcomes. Developers implement features with a focus on testability and maintainability, while QA specialists validate quality and acceptance criteria. Throughout execution, teams maintain a Risk Register to track and mitigate potential issues, escalating blockers through defined paths from team-level triage to sponsor involvement when necessary. Communication cadences are intentionally structured with weekly PM-Product Lead syncs, twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates.

Quality and continuous improvement are embedded throughout the process. Teams leverage project boards (such as GitHub Projects) with clear workflow stages, enforce small pull request sizes with automated CI checks, and maintain comprehensive test coverage spanning unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. After each sprint, release, or significant milestone, teams conduct retrospectives to capture learnings and define actionable improvements with clear owners and timelines. This commitment to iterative refinement, combined with transparent reporting through velocity tracking, burndown charts, and real-time dashboards, ensures teams deliver reliable software while continuously evolving their practices based on evidence and team feedback.

## Getting Started

New team members should begin with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand OctoAcme's principles and approach. From there, explore phase-specific documents as needed for your role or current project phase. For active projects, keep the Project Charter updated in your project repository. Consider adding process-specific documentation to `.copilot/` for enhanced Copilot Spaces context.
